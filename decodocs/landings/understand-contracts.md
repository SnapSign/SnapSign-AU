## The Problem
Contracts are written for lawyers, not for people running a business.

Freelancers and small business owners often sign documents they:
- don't fully understand
- are unsure about
- are afraid to question

One misunderstood clause can cost time, money, or trust.

## How DecoDocs Helps

- Highlights risky or one-sided clauses
- Flags obligations, deadlines, and penalties
- Lets you ask "what does this mean?" in context
