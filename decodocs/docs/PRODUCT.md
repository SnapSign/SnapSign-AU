## What DecoDocs Is

DecoDocs is an AI-powered document workspace for
**freelancers and small business owners**.

It helps users:
- understand documents
- manage them over time
- share, sign, and act on them confidently

DecoDocs is not just about reading documents.
It is about **running a business with documents**.

---

## The Core Problem

Freelancers and SMBs deal with documents constantly:
- contracts
- invoices
- proposals
- policies
- agreements

Their real problems are:
- "I'm not sure what this really means"
- "I don't know if this is risky"
- "I don't want to make a mistake"
- "I need to send this and get it signed"
- "I need to find this again later"

Using multiple tools increases confusion and risk.

DecoDocs brings these needs into **one place**.

---

## Core Model: Understand -> Manage -> Act

### Understand (Decode)
- explain documents in plain language
- translate when needed
- highlight risks and obligations
- catch mistakes and inconsistencies
- clarify unclear sections
- suggest improvements

Understanding reduces uncertainty.

---

### Manage (Own the Document)
- store documents securely
- keep explanations and notes attached
- organize by client or project
- search by meaning
- preserve context over time
- generate invoices and receipts
- templates for common agreements
- add watermarks when needed

Management prevents chaos and loss of knowledge.

---

### Act (Do Business)
- share documents with clients
- send for signature
- sign documents
- track status and history
- keep signed versions and proof
- set reminders for deadlines and payments

Action turns understanding into revenue and protection.

---

## What DecoDocs Is NOT

- not just an e-signature tool
- not legal advice
- not an enterprise compliance platform
- not a document dumping ground
- not unlimited free document processing

DecoDocs is **practical, clarity-first, and business-oriented**.

---

## Target Users

Initial focus:
- freelancers
- consultants
- small business owners
- founders

These users need:
- confidence
- speed
- simplicity
- fewer tools, not more

---

## Product Principles

- understanding is the foundation
- managing documents is essential
- acting on documents is the payoff
- reduce cognitive load
- keep workflows human-readable
- prefer clarity over automation theater

If a feature does not help users
**understand, manage, or act**, it does not belong.

---

## Feature Surfaces (Secondary)

Features show up in multiple places, but they are never the first door:
- inside the app
- on `/features` (secondary, optional)
- inside blog posts
- in tooltips and onboarding

---

## Site Structure (Recommended)

- `/` -> main positioning
- `/understand-contracts`
- `/explain-documents`
- `/find-risky-clauses`
- `/share-and-sign`
- `/manage-documents`
- `/pricing`

Each page has:
1. one problem
2. one promise
3. one primary CTA (decode/upload)

Draft landing content lives in:
- `landings/understand-contracts.md`
- `landings/explain-documents.md`
- `landings/find-risky-clauses.md`
- `landings/share-and-sign.md`
- `landings/manage-documents.md`

## Problem Page Mapping

| Problem page | Features used |
| --- | --- |
| Understand contracts | explain + translate |
| Find risky clauses | warnings + checks |
| Share and sign | storage + sharing + signing |
| Manage documents | storage + search + reminders |

---

## Long-Term Vision

DecoDocs aims to become:

> The place where freelancers and small businesses
> understand, manage, and confidently act on their documents --
> from first read to final signature and beyond.
