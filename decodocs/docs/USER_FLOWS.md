# User Flows

This document describes how users interact with DecoDocs at a conceptual level.

DecoDocs is built around **three pillars** that reflect how freelancers and small
business owners actually work with documents:

1. **Understand** -- reduce uncertainty
2. **Manage** -- own and organize documents
3. **Act** -- do business (share, sign, prove, reuse)

These pillars are sequential but interconnected.

Understanding is the foundation.
All other actions depend on it.

## Guiding Principle

Every flow should answer one question:

> "Do I clearly understand this document, and can I safely act on it?"

If the answer is yes, DecoDocs has succeeded.
