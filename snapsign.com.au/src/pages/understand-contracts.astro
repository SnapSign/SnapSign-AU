      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Contracts are written for lawyers, not for people running a business. Freelancers and small business owners often sign documents they don't fully understand, are unsure about, or are afraid to question. One misunderstood clause can cost time, money, or trust.
      </p>
