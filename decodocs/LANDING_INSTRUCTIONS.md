# LANDINGS_INSTRUCTIONS.md

This document explains how to create **effective landing pages** for DecoDocs.
It combines product-led problem framing with high-conversion design principles.

Each landing page should be **laser-focused on a specific user pain**, not features.
Visitors must *instantly* see their problem and how DecoDocs solves it.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Core Landing Page Principles

### 1) Match visitor intent
Visitors come with a specific problem in mind.
Your page must speak to that **exact problem**, not a vague product overview.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Example headlines:
- "Understand your contract before you sign"
- "Find risky clauses freelancers miss"
- "Explain business documents in plain English"

These must align with the traffic source (search, ad, community link).

---

### 2) One page = one conversion goal
Each landing page should drive **one primary action**:
> *upload document to decode*
or
> *sign up / upgrade plan*

Avoid multiple CTAs before the value moment.
Remove navigation links that distract from the core goal.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

### 3) Strong immediate value
People decide in ~3 seconds whether to stay.
The hero must combine:
- clear headline
- concise subheadline
- immediate value promise
- strong, visible CTA

The subheadline supports the headline and elaborates value.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

### 4) Clean, uncluttered design
Less is more.
Remove anything that does not push visitors toward the conversion action.
Whitespace and visual hierarchy help guide the eye.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

Keep these rules:
- no distracting menus
- minimal outbound links
- large, contrasting CTA buttons

---

### 5) Match the offer to traffic source
If traffic comes from:
- search: reflect the search query in the headline
- ads: mirror the ad language
- referral: match linked context

This reduces bounce and increases trust.:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

### 6) Mobile-first design
Most traffic is mobile.
Ensure:
- fast load times
- big tappable buttons
- short forms
- no awkward scroll behavior

Mobile optimization directly affects conversion rates.:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

### 7) Minimal form friction
If you collect emails or signups:
- only ask for what you *need*
- delay heavy data collection until after the value moment

Long forms kill conversions.

---

### 8) Social proof / credibility (when available)
If you have testimonials, user counts, case snippets, or logos:
- place them near the CTA
- provide evidence visitors trust the product

Trust reduces hesitation.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

Each landing page should include:

1. **Hero section**

## Landing Page Funnels

A set of entry pages is tied to key problems:

```

/understand-contracts
/explain-documents
/find-risky-clauses
/share-and-sign
/manage-documents
/pricing

```

Each page must:
- speak the *specific intent*
- contain above checklist elements
- drive to a primary conversion action

Drafts live in:
- `landings/understand-contracts.md`
- `landings/explain-documents.md`
- `landings/find-risky-clauses.md`
- `landings/share-and-sign.md`
- `landings/manage-documents.md`

## Testing & Optimization

Landing pages are not static. Conversion optimization requires:
- A/B testing (headline, CTA, visuals)
- Heatmaps / behavior analysis
- Adjusting based on real traffic data

Conversion improvement is continuous.:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Tracking & Analytics

Every landing page must report:
- visits
- CTA clicks
- form submissions
- upload starts

Use:
- UTM parameters
- HubSpot events
- heatmaps (optional)

This gives you actionable insights.

---

## Final Rules

- Speak *the user's language*, not product jargon
- Focus on **one transformation**
- Make the CTA obvious and compelling
- Continuously measure and improve

High conversion is the result of:
> *clarity + simplicity + alignment with intent*:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
