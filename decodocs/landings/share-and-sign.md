# Share and Sign Documents with Confidence

## Headline
Share and sign documents with confidence.

## Subheadline
DecoDocs lets you understand documents first -- then share and sign them knowing exactly what you're agreeing to.

## Primary CTA
**Upload a document to get started**

## The Problem
Sending documents to clients without full clarity leads to:
- misunderstandings
- endless questions
- disputes later

Signing blindly is worse.

---

## How DecoDocs Helps
- Keep explanations attached to documents
- Share documents with context
- Send for signature after understanding
- Track status and history

Understanding comes first. Action comes next.

---

## What You Get
- Fewer back-and-forth questions
- Faster agreements
- Clear record of what was shared and signed

---

## How It Works
1. Upload and decode a document
2. Share it with a client
3. Send for signature when ready

## CTA
**Upload a document and share it**
