## Company story

Snap Sign Pty Ltd was started with a simple idea: document work should be easier, faster, and more human.  
Many teams still lose time in fragmented document workflows, manual steps, and unclear collaboration.  
We are building practical tools that reduce friction and help people move from draft to decision with confidence.

Snap Sign is a startup with a product mindset: focus on real user pain, ship useful improvements quickly, and keep iterating.
