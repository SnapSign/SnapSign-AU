      Understand Your Documents Before You Sign

      DecoDocs explains contracts in plain English, highlights risks, and helps you sign with confidence
    </h2>
    <p class="problem-statement">
      Contracts and business documents are written for lawyers, not for people running a business. One misunderstood clause can cost you time, money, or trust. DecoDocs translates complex documents into plain language so you know exactly what you're agreeing to.
